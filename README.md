# Haskell-Lambda-Calculus-Challenges

This assignment tackles some functional programming challenges associated with
interpreting, translating, analysing and parsing variations of the lambda calculus, a language which is
known to be Turing complete. These challenges give additional insights into the
mechanisms used to implement functional languages, practice with some advanced functional
programming techniques such as pattern matching over recursive data types, complex recursion, and
the use of monads in parsing. Each challenge is independent of another.
